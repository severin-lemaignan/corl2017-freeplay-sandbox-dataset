  Abstract                 = {Presents a theoretical analysis of the representational mechanism underlying a child's ability to pretend. This mechanism extends the power of the infant's existing capacity for (primary) representation, creating a capacity for "metarepresentation." It is this, developing toward the end of infancy, that underlies the child's new abilities to pretend and to understand pretense in others. There is a striking isomorphism between the 3 fundamental forms of pretend play and 3 crucial logical properties of mental state expressions in language. This isomorphism points to a common underlying form of internal representation that is here called metarepresentation. A performance model, the "decoupler," is outlined embodying ideas about how an infant might compute the complex function postulated to underlie pretend play. This model also reveals pretense as an early manifestation of the ability to understand mental states. Aspects of later preschool development, both normal and abnormal, are discussed in the light of the new model.},

Yet, every individual moves differently from everyone else (faster/slower, harder/smoother, etc.). We propose here an index of such variability, namely an individual motor signature (IMS) able to capture the subtle differences in the way each of us moves. We show that the IMS of a person is time-invariant and that it significantly differs from those of other individuals. This allows us to quantify the dynamic similarity, a measure of rapport between dynamics of different individuals{\textquoteright} movements, and demonstrate that it facilitates coordination during interaction. We use our measure to confirm a key prediction of the theory of similarity that coordination between two individuals performing a joint-action task is higher if their motions share similar dynamic features. Furthermore, we use a virtual avatar driven by an interactive cognitive architecture based on feedback control theory to explore the effects of different kinematic features of the avatar motion on coordination with human players.},

One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

  Abstract                 = {{For many years, theories of collaborative learning tended to focus on how individuals function in a group. More recently, the focus has shifted so that the group itself has become the unit of analysis. In terms of empirical research, the initial goal was to establish whether and under what circumstances collaborative learning was more effective than learning alone. Researchers controlled several independent variables (size of the group, composition of the group, nature of the task, communication media, and so on). However, these variables interacted with one another in a way that made it almost impossible to establish causal links between the conditions and the effects of collaboration. Hence, empirical studies have more recently started to focus less on establishing parameters for effective collaboration and more on trying to understand the role which such variables play in mediating interaction. In this chapter, we argue that this shift to a more process-oriented account requires new tools for analysing and modelling interactions.}},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter describes recent theory and research in one limited area of social-cognitive development, namely, the childhood acquisition of knowledge about visual perception. The author and his co-workers have hypothesized that there are two developmental levels of such knowledge. At earlier-developing Level 1, the child understands that others as well as the self see objects, and is also able to infer correctly what objects they do or do not currently see if provided with adequate cues. At later-developing Level 2, the child understands not only that people can see objects, but also that they can have differing visual experiences while seeing the same object; most notably, they can have different spatial perspectival views of it when looking at it from different positions. Arguments and evidence for the developmental distinction between Level 1 and Level 2 knowledge are briefly presented in Section I. A more detailed model of Level 1 knowledge is presented in Section II, together with an account of several studies of its development during the first four years of life. During these early years, children appear to learn a great deal about how to produce visual percepts in others (showing and pointing to things), how to deprive others of percepts (hide objects), and how to diagnose the percepts they currently have (follow others' direction of gaze and pointing gestures). Section III similarly reviews recent theory and research on the development of Level 2 perspective-taking knowledge in older children. This work is focused mainly on the acquisition and use of very general perspective-taking rules, such as the rule that two observers who look at an object array from the same spatial position must on that account necessarily have identical perspectival views of the array. Section IV described further developmental research that could be or is being done on Level 2 knowledge, Level 1 knowledge, and on the Level 1-Level 2 distinction.},

Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to the table. The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile household robots need much knowledge about objects, places and actions when performing more and more complex tasks. They must be able to recognize objects, know what they are and how they can be used. We present a practical approach to robot knowledge representation that combines description logics knowledge bases with a rich environment model, data mining and (self-) observation modules. The robot observes itself and humans while executing actions and uses the collected experiences to learn models of action-related concepts grounded in its perception and action system. We demonstrate our approach by learning places that are involved in mobile robot manipulation actions, by locating objects based on their function and by supplying knowledge required for understanding underspecified task descriptions as commonly given by humans.},
